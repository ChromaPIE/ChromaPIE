# I'M QUITTING SHIT ABOUT MINECRAFT (LEAST FOR A WHILE) BC:
- The game's not fun anymore
- What even is NeoForge??
- Localizing mods exhausts and it don't make money, nobody even appreciates you for that. Also all those dramas escalated by those bitch ass nerds. I'm so done.
- I owe CurseForge money (true story)
- Been trying to be a content creator but no luck
- I'm literally 23yr with no bitches rn
- **I got shit setup** (If I got enough cash for a whole new setup imma jump straight back into this shitty game I swear to god)
- K-POP is more fun.
- TikTok is more fun.
- After taking a break from all those shit about this game for one month or two I gotta spend my life just to pick all the mess up.
- My life's a mess too
- If you are reading this, hey.
- Why are you here reading this tho
