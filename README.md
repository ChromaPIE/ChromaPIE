Every single weebs should be gathered and sent to another planet.

Like, why in the name of fark would there be so many male person from my sacred motherland China developing projects and working on Minecraft things, but with Avatar showing a Japanese anime girls in avatars and talking about that Genshin Impact and shit all day long, **AND CHATS ONLINE LIKE A FUCKING ANIME THOT**.

Get a girlfriend, meet some friends, take a tour with your parents, enjoy lives irl, okay?
